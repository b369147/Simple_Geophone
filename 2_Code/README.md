1. **In this document you should record changes in every version, use title2(with ##) to specify the changes you made in this version. **

2. **Change the version name after you complete the changes,** if you modified slightly, change the sub version number, such as V1-2 to V1-3; If you change the whole principle of the project(such as structure, etc.), you should change the main version name, such as from V1-2 to V2-1.
